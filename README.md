# Simple Note-Taking App

This project is a simple note-taking application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). It allows users to create, view, update, and delete personal notes. This application is designed as a demonstration of a full-stack development project, integrating a React frontend with an Express and MongoDB backend.

## Features

- **Create Notes**: Users can add new notes with titles and content.
- **View Notes**: All notes are displayed in a list where any user can view them.
- **Update Notes**: Users can edit the details of existing notes.
- **Delete Notes**: Users can remove notes they no longer need.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is styled with TailwindCSS for a responsive layout that works on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React, styled with TailwindCSS.
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express.js.
- **Database**: MongoDB, with Mongoose for schema definition and data management.
- **Additional Libraries**: Axios for frontend HTTP requests.
